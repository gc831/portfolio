                <p>
                    My name is Giovanni Colon. I am a Navy veteran originally from New Jersey but no living in Texas. I spent 9 years in the 
                    Navy as a Master at Arms with my last 3 years being a recruiter. I then got out and started pursuing a career in IT. I 
                    obtained my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certification which helped me land my first job in the field. I also started to attending 
                    classes here at AMU pursuing my Associates of Science in Computer Technology. This is my last class! I've changed my 
                    degree twice and it feels great to finally get to this point. I want to get my bachelors afterwards but I am going to enjoy 
                    this accomplishment for a bit first haha. In my off time my favorite thing is to ride my motorcycles. Second favorite thing is eating food. ðŸ˜Ž
